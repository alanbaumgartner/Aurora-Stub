# Aurora RAT Stub

## About

Aurora RAT or Remote Administration Tool is written in Go.

This project was started to learn networking in go and get myself started in the security field.

This is the source to the stub of Aurora RAT.

## Usage

The stub requires you to embed the persist.exe by using [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata).

Compile persist.go separately and then place it in the data folder.
