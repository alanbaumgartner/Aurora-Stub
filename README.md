# Aurora RAT Stub

## About

Aurora RAT or Remote Administration Tool is written in Go, using wxGo as a GUI toolkit.

This project was started to learn networking in go and get myself started in the security field.

This is the source to the stub of Aurora RAT.

## Usage

The stub requires you to embed the persist.exe by using [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata).

Compile persist.go separately and then place it in the data folder.

## Aurora Control Panel

The control panel is found [here](https://github.com/alanbaumgartner/Aurora).
